# SuperHeroRoster

The way this code works is by allowing the user to have an interface to interact with rather than simple code that just displays information about Marvel Super Heroes. The first part of this code Initializes three arrays. Hero names, abilities, and power levels. the second is the main loop interface that gives the user four options to choose from and interact with the Marvel Roster. The third is the first option of the interface which is to veiw the current roster. What this does is displays all of the super heroes in a table, sorted by their power levels and calculates the average power level. The fourth is the second option which is to search for a specific hero within the roster that was displayed. The search option is case-sensitive. If the hero is found within the heroNames array it will display the Super Hero name, abilities and power level. But if the super hero is not found it will display a not found error message. The fifth is he third option which allows the user to add a super hero to the roster. It will as the user to input the name, abilities and the power level of the hero. after all of the information is inputted all of the arrays will expand to allow for the new hero to be added. As well as update the roster to add the new hero. Finally the sixth which is the fourth option that just exits the program.
